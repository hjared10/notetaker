Some were smaller, but still vigirous, but at the end of the hall, in the corner, some of the flames were smaller.  Some wept with little light, and some barely fumed with smoke.  Over the corner, at the end of the room, sat the smallest cinders.  They seemed to whimper, and plead, and for a second it sputered and almost went out.  And youll ask, whose is that dying light?  and the answer will come, yours."
